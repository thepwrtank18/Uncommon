# Uncommon
Shell for the EGL alternative, Legendary.

It's nothing special, just a command line. You don't have to type out "legendary" for every command you type in. For example, "legendary install Eider" is just "install Eider".

## Building
You'll need the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). After you install that, type "dotnet build [path to project file]".
